This is the best excursion ever. At 8 a.m. I arrived at the school's gates, and saw two big buses parking on the other side. We assembled in the courtyard for a few minutes and boarded the bus. After more than one hour's driving, we arrived at Kryal Castle!
We jumped off excitedly and entered the castle. Our class got archery, shooting arrows on hay. Very few people shot hardly on the lay, and only one student shot on the red target.
Leatherwork is fun too. The teacher told us all about leather, including #it can be made of human skin#, and #it can be made of urine#! Yuck... We wet leather and hammered letters on it, including letters and symbols. Then our teacher punched holes on our leathers.
And we made medicine, which is mashed up herbs. Our teacher came to check if it is sticky.
We reviewed The Battle of Hastings, and the teacher chose assistants to demonstrate, and at last we fought each other for fun.
And at last, we danced some medieval dances. After resting in the shade, we took the buses back to school again!
